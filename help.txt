Hi!
If you are here, I suppose that you want to learn Spanish.
In addition to learning a language, you can also test your memory with this memory game.
First, select the language level which you want to practice, and then the number of the cards.
On the game board, there are word pairs; one word is in English and the other in Spanish.
Begin the game by flipping a card,
then try to find its match among the other cards.
If you can't find a pair, the flipped cards will be turned back face down again.
Try to remember these words, as it becomes easier to find pairs the more you play.
When you find a pair, it is removed from the board,
and when you find all the pairs, you have completed the level.
Your score calculation will be based on factors such as time,
number of cards, language level, and the number of mistakes you make.

Have a good game, and I hope you will learn a lot!

Thanks for using my program.
